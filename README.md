 [YOLOV5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5) + [SAHI](https://github.com/obss/sahi) for Plane and Ship Detection in Satellite Images. For the plane detection scenario for inference we used images from [Pleiades](https://earth.esa.int/eogateway/missions/pleiades), and as far as the ship detection scenario is concerned an Image from [Planet](https://www.planet.com/) was used.
